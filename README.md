# Welcome to Pressure

To run this game, you should execute the `pressure.py` file.

When the game is loaded, there is a *How to Play* option on the main menu. This will tell you everything you need to know about how to play the game. 

You can customise the controls (including the boss key) in the *Controls* option. By default, movement is done with the arrow keys and the boss key is the spacebar.

You should also be aware of the following additional cheat codes that are not covered in the *Controls* section:

- Ctrl + Shift + R: This will reset all pressure plates to their full time period (and hence make them green).
- Ctrl + Shift + F: This will allow  the player to "float" and pass over the top of walls.

There is some pre-loaded data in the scoreboard, which is taken from me testing the game.

**This game is designed to run in 1920x1080 resolution.** The gameplay will run in full screen. The close window button in menus has been disabled deliberately; please use the buttons within the window to navigate/close menus.
